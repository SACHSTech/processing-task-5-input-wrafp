# Processing Task 5 - Input

## Learning Objectives
In this task, you will learn about:
* Mouse Input
  * The `mouseX` and `mouseY` Variables
  * The `mousePressed` Variable
  * Mouse Input Functions
  * Combining Input Variables and Event Functions
* Keyboard Input
  * The `keyPressed` Variable
  * The `key` Variable
  * The `keyCode` Variable
  * Keyboard Input Functions
  * Handling Multiple Keys


## Step 1 - Lesson
Acquire the learning objectives by reviewing [this page from Happycoding.io](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/input)

## Step 2 - Task
Create a drawing program for a specific scene. For example, you could create a garden drawing program where clicking creates flowers (randomly sized and colored?), dragging creates grass, the mouse wheel adds butterflies, keyboard changes the background or sky.  You can re-use functions from previous tasks defined to draw items to the screen (i.e flowers, clouds, etc).  The objective is to demonstrate your ability to do as many of the lesson learning objectives as possible.  

## Evaluation
